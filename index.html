        <p>Quip still use similar token rules to Javascript, so large number of rules is javascript's rules. All rules is defined in https://github.com/yorkie/quip/blob/master/src/token.h#L17-L77</p>
        <p>This issue would be a documentation to specify the meaning of every tokens:</p>
        <p>ILLEGAL: shows that an invalided syntax, this might be an error in runtime, for example, a special character like ^ maybe illegal.</p>
        <p>EOS: is short for End of Source, Yes, it means the program has eat up the source file, and related files.</p>
        <p>NEWLINE: in literal, it means that a new line.</p>

        <p>The problem is about forever. While using this module to start a script, everything is OK, at an opposite of this operation, everything is not pretty good. Following simple codes is an example.</p>
        <p>At 1st time, I did a lookup in forever, then I found it stop a script or process by killing it, namely call the signal named SIGKILL. Codes is fixed on: nodejitsu/forever-monitor</p>
        <p>I was actually thinking that the full success would be coming, such that I coded this:</p>
        <p>Fool, fuck self-confidence.</p>
        <p>Had googled some blogs, I realized this way is absolutely wrong. I cannot handle the SIGKILL, It's an absolute quit system signal, then I know why forever stop scripts by this way. But what is this problem's solution? Of course I find an answer to solve it, like that.</p>
