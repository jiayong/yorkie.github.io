# Sakura - an awesome synchronous robot

I am always looking for an easy way to manage my posts, and have to try large numbers of blog tools, but still annoyed by this problem until Sakura borned now.

Sakura is incomplete as a synchronous rebot, however it has been easy enough for us.
You might post your thoughts in markdown like what I'm doing now, then just push your post to [github.com](https://github.com), Sakura would generate website automaticly.

```bash
$ git push https://github.com/yorkie/yorkie.git master
```

Once commits([git](http://git-scm.com/)) have been submitted to your remote repo, you could see your post right now. Not only that, because your posts have been pushed to github, you could also see them at [github.com](https://github.com) without sync manully. It's amazing, right?

### More social

In next stage of Sakura, I plan to hightlight this feature, it would send a post to your twitter, facebook, google plus and instagram once a commit has been submitted.

### Summary

This is why I want to write this post tool, Sakura, It's really easy enough in your control, enjoy her.
